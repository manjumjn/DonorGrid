# DonorGrid

> Accept donations from around the globe instantly

DonorGrid is a ready-to-use headless donor management system for NGOs and other similar organization provided for free. It can be used with literally any website and make it accept donation in no-time (of course integration time excluded).

I have been inspired for this project from https://youwecan.org. It not only solves the problem for SMBs who take responsibility to build donation websites but also help the donors to donate money in their currencies.

## Feature

1. Ready to integrate APIs
2. Multi-user management panel for the staff with granular permissions
3. Create pre-configured packages of donation with amount and currency
4. Accept custom amount in donor specified currency. [See here](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/reference/currency-codes/)
5. Support three popular payment gateways: [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) and [RazorPay](https://razorpay.com)
